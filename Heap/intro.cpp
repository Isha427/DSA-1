>used in heap sort

>two types:
    >Min Heap:highest priority item is assigned lowest value
    >Max Heap::highest priority item is assigned highest value
>Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree: Sorted as an array
>left(i)=2i+1
>right(i)=2i+2
>parent(i)=floor((i-1)/2)
>cache friendly
>minimum height
>random access
>no space wastage only n cells


>Min Heap: 
    >complete binary tree
    >every node has value smaller than its descendents

>Max Heap: 
    >complete binary tree
    >every node has value greater than its descendents
