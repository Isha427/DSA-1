/*
ide: keep height as O(logn)
background: same set of keys can make different height BSTs
-> if we know keys in advance we can make a perfectly balacned BST
-> how to keep it balanced when random insertions/deletions happening?
-> the idea is do some restructring (or re-balancing) when doing insertions/deletions.

1- AVL Tree
2- Red Black Tree
