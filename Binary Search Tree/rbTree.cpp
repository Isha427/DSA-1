>every node is either red or black

>no two consecutive reds
>number of black nodes from every node to all of its descandents leaves should be same

>not as strict as AVL, loose compared to AVL
>loose balancing cause less rotations, but height may get higher


>number of nodes on the path from a node to its farthest descendents leaf should not be more than twice than the number of nodes on the path to the closest descendent leaf.
