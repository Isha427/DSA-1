// 1. either size is fixed or pre-allocated (in both fixed and variable sized array) OR the worst insertion at the end is 0(n).
// 2. insertion at middle or beginning is costly.
// 3. deletion at middle or beginning is costly.
// 4. implementation of data structures like queue and deque is complex with arrays.
