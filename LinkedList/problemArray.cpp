// Problems with Arrays:
/*
1. either size is fixed or pre-allocated (in both fixed and variable sized array) OR the worst insertion at the end is 0(n).
2. insertion at middle or beginning is costly.
3. deletion at middle or beginning is costly.
4. implementation of data structures like queue and deque is complex with arrays.
